# Pong_PSP
A basic version of Pong written in C for PSP
I wanted to try my hand at PSP homebrew since I had mine laying around. What better way to start than by making a pong clone?

# Requirements
PSPSDK (https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk)

# Building the project
You can build the project using "make"

#Running the game
The game can be run in an emulator such as PPSSPP using the EBOOT.PBP file created by the build.
